To run the gawk version, you must have gawk and gawkextlib.

To get gawkextlib, you can:
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/u/paulinohuerta/gawkextlib u-paulinohuerta-gawkextlib

The README file in that repository will explain how to build the Redis extensions for gawk.

To run the code from chapter 1 (after your Redis client is properly installed):

  $ /path-to-gawk/gawk -f ch01.awk /dev/null
